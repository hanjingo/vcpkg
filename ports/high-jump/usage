This port installs the High Jump (high-jump) C++17 library framework.

This library is header-only. The port configures the project with
`-DBUILD_LIB=OFF` so no compiled library artifacts are installed â€” only
the public headers are provided under the include directory.

Basic CMake usage (header-only):

  find_package(hj CONFIG REQUIRED)

  add_executable(myapp main.cpp)
  target_link_libraries(myapp PRIVATE hj::hj)

Notes:
- The port installs headers to ${includedir}/hj so consumers can `find_package(hj)` and
  link to the imported target `hj::hj` (header-only interface).
- BUILD_LIB is intentionally set to OFF in the port because high-jump is header-only.
- License: GPL-3.0-only. Ensure your project licensing is compatible before using.
